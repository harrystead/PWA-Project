### Progressive Web App

In this project I utilized webpack's minify and chunking features to help reduce the total size of the application. The application itself is a news aggregator that allows users to read articles by their favourite topics.

(API only available in development)

The app allows users to select their favourite topics. These topics are clickable and take the user to a page of news articles related to the chosen topic.

Then the user is able to save their favourite articles which are displayed on the 'favorites' page.
